# MAC Address Changer
# About
A lightweight program that allows you to easily change and store MAC addresses. I made it because I was tired of typing all the commands into the Terminal by hand.
Please report bugs and give suggestions on GitHub.
##
# How to use
Unzip the Archive, open the directory in the Terminal and run the code using `python3 MacAddressChanger.py`.
Please report any issues.
